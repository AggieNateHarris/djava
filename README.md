DJava
=====
So, basically I'm thinking of creating an application server.  The DjavaServer class opens a socket.  Nginx can be configured to proxy that localhost port.  


Current Status
==============
  - Great little echo bot.  
  - Proxied interaction behind Nginx on localhost has been demonstrated.  
  - HTTP GET request implementation is in progress

Why DJava? Because no one actually likes Django.  Well, at least I don't, but according to market share stats, I'm not the only one.
